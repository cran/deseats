\title{Time Series Filtering Using the Hamilton Filter}
\usage{
hamilton_filter(yt, h = NULL, p = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{yt}{a time series object of class \code{ts} or an object that can be 
transformed to that class using \code{\link[stats]{as.ts}}.}

\item{h}{the backwards time skip for the first regressor; the default is 
the seasonal period in \code{yt} multiplied by 2.}

\item{p}{the number of regressors; the default is the seasonal period in
\code{yt}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements is returned.
\describe{
\item{decomp}{an object of class \code{"mts"} that consists of the
decomposed time series data.}
\item{ts_name}{the object name of the initially provided time series object.}
\item{frequency}{the frequency of the time series.}
\item{regression_output}{an object of class \code{"lm"}, i.e. basic regression
output.}
}
}
\description{
A stationary remainder is obtained from a univariate time series using the 
filter proposed by Hamilton. The filter is capable of estimating the trend 
together with the seasonality in a series.
}
\details{
Implement the filter by Hamilton (2018) to decompose a time series.
